  * renamed to minitest and pulled out test/unit compatibility.

* 12 minor enhancements:

  * assert_match now checks that act can call =~ and converts exp to a
    regexp only if needed.
  * Added assert_send... seems useless to me tho.
  * message now forces to string... ruby-core likes to pass classes and arrays :(
  * Added -v handling and switched to @verbose from $DEBUG.
  * Verbose output now includes test class name and adds a sortable running time!
  * Switched message generation into procs for message deferment.

  * Improved output for assert_respond_to, assert_same.
  * at_exit now exits false instead of errors+failures.
  * Made the tests happier and more readable imhfo.
  * Switched index(s) == 0 to rindex(s, 0) on nobu's suggestion. Faster.

* 5 bug fixes:

  * 1.9: Added encoding normalization in mu_pp.
  * 1.9: Fixed backtrace filtering (BTs are expanded now)
  * Added back exception_details to assert_raises. DOH.
  * Fixed shadowed variable in mock.rb

    * Removed location_of_failure. Unnecessary.
    * Rewrote test/unit's filter_backtrace. Flog from 37.0 to 18.1

  * Renamed MiniTest::Unit.autotest to #run.
  * Renamed deny to refute.
  * Rewrote some ugly/confusing default assertion messages.
