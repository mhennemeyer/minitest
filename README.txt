= minitest/{unit,spec,mock}

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts

== DESCRIPTION:

minitest/unit is a small and fast replacement for ruby's huge and slow
test/unit. This is meant to be clean and easy to use both as a regular
test writer and for language implementors that need a minimal set of
methods to bootstrap a working unit test suite.

mini/spec is a functionally complete spec engine.

mini/mock, by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock object framework.

(This package was called miniunit once upon a time)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Contains minitest/unit - a simple and clean test system (301 lines!).
* Contains minitest/spec - a simple and clean spec system (52 lines!).
* Contains minitest/mock - a simple and clean mock system (35 lines!).
* Incredibly small and fast runner, but no bells and whistles.

== REQUIREMENTS:

+ Ruby 1.8, maybe even 1.6 or lower. No magic is involved.

== INSTALL:

+ sudo gem install minitest
